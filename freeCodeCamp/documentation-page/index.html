        <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
            readability with the use of significant indentation.</p>
        <p>Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
            structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a
            "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library</p>
        <p>Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.</p>

        <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the
            Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of
            exception handling (from the start plus new capabilities in Python 3.11) and interfacing with the Amoeba
            operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole
            responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent
            vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a title the Python community
            bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. In January
            2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.</p>
        <p>Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features. Python 3.0, released on 3
            December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x. Releases of Python
            3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.</p>
        <p>Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body
            of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. No further security patches or
            other improvements will be released for it. Currently only 3.7 and later are supported. In 2021,
            Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited as all versions of Python (including 2.7) had security issues
            leading to possible remote code execution and web cache poisoning.</p>
        <p>In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited and 3.8.13, and 3.7.13, because of many security
            issues. When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the
            older series 3.8 and 3.7) will only receive security fixes going forward. On September 7, 2022, four new
            releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and
            3.7.14.</p>
        <p>As of November 2022, Python 3.11.0 is the current stable release and among the notable changes from 3.10 are
            that it is 10–60% faster and significantly improved error reporting.</p>
        <p>Python 3.12 (alpha 2) has improved error messages.</p>

        <p>Python's large standard library provides tools suited to many tasks and is commonly cited as one of its
            greatest strengths. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and
            HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational
            databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating
            regular expressions, and unit testing.</p>
        <p>Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications—for example, the Web Server Gateway
            Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333—but most are specified by their code, internal
            documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code,
            only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.</p>
        <p>As of 14 November 2022, the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python
            software, contains over 415,000 packages with a wide range of functionality, including:</p>

        <p>Python's name is derived from the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum
            enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and
            culture; for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs
            instead of the traditional foo and bar. The official Python documentation also contains various
            references to Monty Python routines.</p>
        <p>The prefix Py- is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in
            names of Python applications or libraries include Pygame, a binding of SDL to Python (commonly used to
            create games); PyQt and PyGTK, which bind Qt and GTK to Python respectively; and PyPy, a Python
            implementation originally written in Python.</p>
